## Technical Implementation

### Routing System

The main `DashboardPage.tsx` now acts as a router that displays the appropriate dashboard based on the user's role:

```typescript
// Role-based routing
switch (user.role) {
  case 'IT Admin':
  case 'Admin':
    return <AdminDashboard />;

  case 'Manager':
    return <ManagerDashboard />;

  case 'Employee':
    return <EmployeeDashboard />;

  case 'IT Agent':
  case 'Team Lead':
    return <OperationsDashboard />;
}
```

### Type System Enhancement

Extended the type system in `/src/types/index.ts` to support:

- **Dashboard-specific types**: `DashboardMetrics`, `PerformanceMetrics`
- **Admin panel types**: `AdminPanelConfig`, `CompanyInfo`, `AutomationRule`
- **Manager panel types**: `ManagerDashboardData`, `ApprovalRequest`, `DepartmentStats`
- **Operations types**: `OperationsDashboardData`, `SLAAlert`, `AgentPerformanceMetrics`
- **Employee types**: `EmployeeDashboardData`, `TicketNotification`, `SystemAnnouncement`

### Key Features Across All Panels

1. **Real-time Updates**: All dashboards support real-time data updates
2. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly layouts with Material-UI components
3. **Role-based Access**: Each panel shows only relevant information for the user role
